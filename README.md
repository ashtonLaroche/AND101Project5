# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Ashton LaRoche**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Summary

**MarsPhotos** is an android app that **displays random photos taken by NASA's mars rover using NASA's mars photo api**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ðŸ˜­ðŸš€ðŸ“·**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **for a random sol or martian day**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **NASA's Mars Rover Photos**.

## Video Demo

Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:

**My app worked earlier this evening but didn't work at the time of the recording because the NASA API service is down at the moment. It's supposed to show a random mars rover photo and display the sol (martian day) it was captured on and the Earth date**
